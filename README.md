# IoT-Based-Smart-Agricultural-Monitoring-System
Technologies: ESP32 Microcontroller, Blynk IoT Platform, C/C++ (Arduino IDE), Wi-Fi, Soil Moisture Sensor, DHT Sensor, Water Level/Ultrasonic Sensors.Designed and implemented a comprehensive, low-cost smart agriculture monitoring system aimed at optimizing resource management and increasing farm efficiency. The system leveraged an ESP32 to collect critical environmental data (soil moisture, temperature, humidity) and transmit it in real-time to the Blynk cloud dashboard and mobile application.
Key achievements include:Successfully integrated multiple sensors (DHT, Soil Moisture, Ultrasonic, Flame) to provide a full environmental overview.Developed an automated irrigation function that activates a DC water pump when soil moisture drops below a predefined threshold, leading to water conservation and reduced manual labor.Incorporated safety features, including flame detection that triggers an immediate alert (buzzer/LED) and pump activation for emergency cooling.Enabled remote monitoring and manual override control of the water pump via the Blynk mobile application.
